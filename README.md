# Console-Hangman

Create a hanging game:
you must create a secret word of at least 8 letters and two similar letters.
We will only be able to see in the console from the beginning of the game the first and last letter of the game, the other letters of the word will be replaced by “stars”,like this J********t no like this J, * , * , * ,  * , * , * , * , * , * , T
We will only have 10 attempts to find this word by guessing letter by letter, use prompt() for user input that will ask for a single letter and not a number.
When the player finds a similar letter (like ‘a’ in the word ‘javascript’ Ja*a*t ) it will have to replace the corresponding stars in a single move.
A message will announce the player his victory and stop the game.
